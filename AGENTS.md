# Repository delivery policy

The repository owner uses direct delivery by default.

- When the owner asks to push, publish, sync, or release this repository, work on `main` and push directly to `origin/main`.
- Do not create a feature branch, pull request, or draft PR unless the owner explicitly asks for review or a PR.
- Before a release or direct push, classify every local change. Commit useful repository content; remove disposable output; ignore intentional local-only artifacts. Do not use a stash to bypass a clean-worktree check.
- A release is complete only after local `main` equals `origin/main` and `git status --porcelain` is empty.
